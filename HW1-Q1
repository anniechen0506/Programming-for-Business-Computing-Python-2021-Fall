#Question:
There is a person who loves to eat scallion pancakes and drink grapefruit green tea the most. Tonight, he takes out x dollars from his wallet and goes to the Gongguan Night Market. He plans to pass by a stall selling scallion pancakes for p1 dollars and a beverage shop selling grapefruit green tea for p2 dollars in order. He will try to buy a scallion pancake first, and if he doesn't have enough money, he will skip it. Whether or not he buys the scallion pancake, he will then try to buy a cup of grapefruit green tea, and if he doesn't have enough money, he will skip it. After visiting both stalls, he will return home.

For example, if he brings 100 dollars out and a scallion pancake costs 40 dollars, he will buy one; then a cup of grapefruit green tea costs 35 dollars, he will buy one; finally, he will return home with 25 dollars. If he brings 100 dollars out and a scallion pancake costs 40 dollars, he will buy one; then a cup of grapefruit green tea costs 95 dollars, he will skip it; finally, he will return home with 60 dollars.

Please write a program to input the above information and calculate the amount of money he has left after returning home.
